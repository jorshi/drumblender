# Example config file for a simple regression task
#
# Note that we can use the `class_name` parameter to cause LightningCLI to instantiate
# a class from a string. The `init_args` parameter is used to pass arguments to the
# constructor of the class.
#
# We can also group related configurations in sub-config files and include them simply
# by passing their path, as illustrated below.
